## 🚀 Management Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Utilize Views">
    Use the sidebar filters to switch between **Sessions**, **Top Activity**, **LOA**, and **On Track** views to get a holistic picture of your team's health.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consistent Scheduling">
    For regular events, use the **Scheduled session** toggle with a **Weekly** frequency to automate your calendar and save time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Role Definitions">
    When adding **Session Slots**, clearly label roles like "Co-Host" to ensure staff members know their responsibilities upon joining.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Use the **Status** feature to automate your workflow. By setting a status to activate at "0 minutes," you ensure the session starts with the correct label immediately.
