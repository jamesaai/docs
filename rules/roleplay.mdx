## 🚀 Session Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Naming">
    Use distinct names like "Basic Training - 5 PM" rather than just "Training" to avoid confusion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Role Discipline">
    Ensure you only enable role groups that are actually required for the session to prevent overcrowding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Audits">
    Review your Session Settings monthly to remove outdated event types or update descriptions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Automation:** Properly configured sessions work seamlessly with Discord webhooks to announce events automatically!
